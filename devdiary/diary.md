# Dev Diary / Postmortem

I've decided to attempt 2 entries to JS13k this year, this entry will concentrate on being playable on desktop and mobile.

I've put my initial interpretation of the theme and game ideas in my [main entry](https://github.com/picosonic/js13k-2021).

Here is a rough diary of progress as posted on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/femtosonic) and taken from notes and [commit logs](https://github.com/picosonic/js13k-2021/commits/)..

For my second attempt at an entry for 2021, I'd like to explore a simple but addictive game which can be played on both mobile and desktop and which may include an element of decentralisation. I'm going to start with a flat 2D game, but may add a 3D aspect to it if time allows.
