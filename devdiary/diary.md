# Dev Diary / Postmortem

I've decided to attempt 2 entries to JS13k this year, this entry will concentrate on being playable on desktop and mobile.

I've put my initial interpretation of the theme and game ideas in my main entry.

Here is a rough diary of progress as posted on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/femtosonic) and taken from notes and [commit logs](https://github.com/picosonic/js13k-2021/commits/)..

Getting some game ideas before starting to think about doing coding experiments. I like the thought of doing more than one game. Perhaps a 2D and a 3D one, but I may run out of time very quickly unless I make one of them really simple to code but really fun to play.
